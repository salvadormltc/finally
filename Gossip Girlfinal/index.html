              <p>Good morning Lisbon insiders, as you know girls have great value for boys, as they also have a great influence,
                oh... how are women so unique, don't you think? I'm so happy for you lonely boy, it took being with a girl to know that you have to treat someone well, welcome back to your straight
                era because the other one was quite a manic experience. 
                Poor S would have thought that a person could be a human laboratory rat. But don’t worry , you finally escaped the cage and now you can be finally free, enjoy your freedom S because I know you'll need it.
                
                you know you love me.

            <p>Some stories open the door for something more and then there are fairy-tale endings, where the boy gets his princess and endings that turn you introspective about your own life…and your place in the world. 
              And then there’s the ending that you saw coming a mile away…and yet somehow still takes you by surprise.
              But don’t worry my Lisbon insiders friends, this story isn’t ending, we’re just at the start of a brand new chapter.

            <p>Spotted S and G in Chiado watching the Christmas lights, mmmm suspicious, could that friendship be more than a friendship, as we all know S has a reputation as a whore, a "traitor" and as mysterious.
              But he's nothing more than a poor kid who just wants his true love. I wish you luck because at this point in the championship we all need someone to go and see the Christmas lights on the 30th.

            <p>Change is part of our life, S finally took out the Starbucks cups he had stored because he thought it could still bring hope to the poor boy, nothing better than moving forward than keeping the memories of past loves in a box.
              But unlike many, S decided to keep because a memory so significant to him does not deserve to be in the trash even if it is a sad memory of love, a person moves on but the thought and memory always remains. 

              stay well my beautiful Lisbon insiders, you know you love me

            <p>Good morning my Lisbon Insiders i was thinking "thank you" is the action that many people are unable to do, we should always be grateful for everything even if it is the smallest thing, we never know how much effort the other person made just
               to receive a thank you. Today I'm grateful for him, I really notice that when he said he was going to find someone better, I ended up finding something better, peace, who are we without peace? We are a lost void in the world, without knowing where to go, today I thank you D from the bottom of my heart because I think it was with my effort and struggle that I realized that I just need peace. the gossip girl found her peace, it's time to find yours, my Lisbon insiders. you know you love me.

              <p>Good morning Lisbon insiders, as we all know, waking up on a Saturday is very difficult when we know that Friday night was very intriguing, what happened last night, stays last night.

            <p>We all know that a repost on Tiktok is a feeling for us, a repost is a new like on videos, as we all know each person has one person as their main priority but here's the question... are you also their priority to the other person?
              This all has a unique meaning, we simply have to know what is an obligation and a priority for us.
              Be careful with your priority, one day it could be your worst nightmare.

            <p>hey Lisbon insiders, I've been thinking about the word “saudade”... it's such a strong word that it can make us sad or regretful.
              “Saudade” is a feeling as well as an event.
              If you're not feeling the longing, one day it will arrive whether you like it or not and if you can destroy it, do that, longing is a sadness and if it's the longing for that person, it's better to stay there so they never come back.
              
              Stay strong my Lisbon insiders, you know you love me.

              is going to France, it's so ironic that two weeks ago I bought two tickets to France but I ended up leaving one behind, as life takes turns and so do people,

              We are left here thinking that it is always good when that person feels pain from time to time, especially when they really deserve to feel that boiling pain in their demon body.
              Good luck with this pain, I hope it lasts as long as possible.
